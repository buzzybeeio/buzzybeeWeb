    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Ali, Software Engineer at App Academy</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Ali Haq. He finished App Academy's Programming Course and is currently teaching there. Ali is extremely knowledgeable, here is his interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“Sure! I actually majored in Economics at Vanderbilt University (down in Nashville). To be quite frank, a huge factor in my choosing the major was what many of my friends were doing; while I enjoyed many of the courses, I didn’t really know what path I would take afterwards. After doing some soul searching, I stumbled across a website called Project Euler, a site that involves solving math problems using code. Coding out a brute force solution and then realizing that there was a more optimal way of doing things was more fun than it should have been. I realized a little later that tech was an industry that I could see myself thriving in, and from there I took a few online courses (on edX and Coursera) and then attended App Academy, a selective coding bootcamp. I also recently went through a service called Triplebyte, which essentially connects you with companies without looking at your background (particularly useful for those of us that don’t have STEM degrees!).”</p>
    <p><strong>What inspired you to become a software engineer?</strong></p>
    <p>“As I mentioned above, doing those problems on Project Euler was really what precipitated everything for me. I’ve always had a love for math and being able to construct a solution to problems by writing some text just blew my mind. Also, my dad worked as a database engineer for Oracle and would always bring home different tech trinkets and that I think planted the seeds from an early age.”</p>
    <p><strong>What are the steps that you have taken to become a software engineer?</strong></p>
    <p>“I’ve completed several problems on Project Euler, CodeWars, Leetcode, Hackerrank, etc. to begin my coding journey (all in a very beginner friendly language called Ruby). After I had some decent familiarity with how to utilize code to solve problems, I took online courses in Computer Science (primarily CS50x from Harvard on edX, and an Intro Data Structures course from Princeton on Coursera). Afterwards I attended App Academy in San Francisco to learn fullstack development, and since then I’ve been a teaching assistant there as well as working on various new projects built with different languages and frameworks.”</p>
    <p><strong>What are some challenges that you had to overcome?</strong></p>
    <p>“I think the biggest thing for me was understanding how many pieces there really were to developing out a complete application. When I came into App Academy, I felt that because I had so much experience solving algorithms and some understanding of low-level programming (I learned C through CS50, which is the language that both two popular high level languages, Ruby and Python, are coded in) that I would be able to breeze through the fullstack curriculum. I definitely underestimated how much more there was–SQL, database management, JavaScript, backend frameworks, frontend frameworks, HTML & CSS, deployment, etc. Now I’m much more comfortable with how an entire app comes together, but it took me a while to wrap my head around all the moving pieces mentioned above. The way I like to learn things is to a fairly low level of abstraction, so I needed to know why we were using certain technologies (for example, many people are told to just learn React because it’s popular in the industry, but why is it needed? What does it bring to the table that jQuery doesn’t, or heck, even JavaScript?). Of course, it’s a balance–sometimes you need to work with the technology to understand why you need it, but I think some reference is always good before diving into a technology.”</p>
    <p><strong>What do you see yourself doing as a software engineer (personal projects)?</strong></p>
    <p>“I really love working with communication protocols, such as WebSockets and WebRTC. One of my favorite projects that I made is a peer-to-peer voice chat visualizer made with WebRTC. Using the app and starting up a call with a friend is a breeze, and I’ve actually used it in lieu of other options such as Skype or Discord to chat with friends. It would be really neat to delve more into these technologies and see what other apps can be made to connect people together.”</p>
    <p><strong>What are some resources that really helped you?</strong></p>
    <p>“The amazing thing about living in the digital age is that we have access to so many great resources online. The best thing for me in getting me entrenched in software development has been CS50x, taught by David Malan. He is truly a gifted lecturer; at times I forgot that I was watching what was even an academic lecture! Not only that, but the way the course is structured really is meant to give you a complete survey about what the field of computer science is about. There is a LOT, but because it is an online course, you can take your time to learn. But it really is comprehensive and I think it can help a lot of people see if software is a field that they want to get into. Also, the instructional staff is incredible as well (Doug Lloyd and Zamyla Chan in particular)!”</p>
    <p><strong>What are your thoughts about App Academy?</strong></p>
    <p>“App Academy was an intense experience, and I learned a whole lot. Like I mentioned above, I came into App Academy thinking that it was going to be a breeze because of all the problems I had done before. How wrong I was! The nice thing is that the instructors there are amazing. They all really know what they’re talking about and go out of their way to help you solve an issue. Additionally, having other students around you all working with the same goal in mind was very motivating and I made a lot of good friends there. However, I do have some reservations about recommending App Academy outright to people new to coding (especially with the recent changes to the pricing structure); what I would advise them to do instead is to go through an online course like CS50 from start to finish, put in some time researching and then perhaps look into a coding bootcamp after they have a general framework for how an app is made from start to finish. But I definitely feel like a coding bootcamp is not necessary, and if one is sufficiently self motivated, they could definitely break into the industry (especially if they already have a STEM degree).”</p>
    <p><strong>What was your support group like during this journey?</strong></p>
    <p>“It was okay, I don’t have any really close family or friends in the Bay area so that was a little tough for me. I do have a friend here from high school that has his own startup, but he’s understandably busy! Of course there’s also other App Academy people, which is nice, but I think there’s this pressure to put on a facade that everything is okay and that the job search is going wonderfully, especially when friends of yours are getting interviews and jobs. Overall it’s a bit weird and I think I would hesitate to tell someone to move out to a completely different city for a coding bootcamp if they didn’t have any family or good friends in the area. I’m also a bit of an introvert so that may have played a role as well.”</p>
