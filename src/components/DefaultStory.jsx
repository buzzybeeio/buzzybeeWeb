      <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Connor Leech. Connor was a Senior Technical Recruiter at MONDO. Connor worked in sales prior to programming. He’s currently working on his own personal project. Here is the interview:</em></p>
      <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
      <p>“After I graduated from college, I went through a lot of Codecademy’s resources and I also attended a coding bootcamp in San Francisco - RocketU. They are no longer around but their main focus were on Python, Django, and Angular. Prior to the bootcamp, I was already familiar with jQuery and Node. I also started blogging once I started attending the bootcamp because I found that writing about what I learned allowed me to solidify my understanding of that topic. After RocketU, I got hired through a recruiting agency as an Angular Developer. It was a contract position for $30/hour and it was a really far commute so it wasn’t the best job. Once the contract was up, I actually ended up working with the recruiting agency because I also had sales experience. Being a recruiter allowed me the inside knowledge of what technologies get people hired and what different types of companies want.” </p>
      <p><strong>Can you share that perspective with us? What kind of technology gets hired?</strong></p>
      <p>“I think that React is way overhyped. This is just my perspective as a recruiter, but not a lot of companies want to shell out 20 - 30% of a candidate’s salary to hire someone. There are a lot of candidates that know JavaScript because everyone that’s learning code is learning JavaScript. The best advice that someone has given me, even though I haven’t been following, is building stuff to get users. By having a user base, you have the attention. Beyond that, learn AWS.”</p>
      <p><strong>Why AWS (Amazon Web Services)?</strong></p>
      <p>“Because there’s a lot of work in Infrastructure. I noticed that there is a huge demand for people who knew AWS.”</p>
      <p><strong>As a recruiter, what type of engineers were you helping? </strong></p>
      <p>“It wasn’t strictly engineers, I placed people from digital marketing to designers to engineering directors. It was really broad. It was more dependent on who the clients were and what kind of talent they needed. It was always tough to place an entry-level engineer for front-end positions because companies would always want 3 - 5 years experience and there are just so many front- end engineers.”</p>
      <p><strong>Let’s talk about front-end engineers then, how did the recruiting agency that you were working for test them?</strong></p>
      <p>"We’d initially screen candidates through conversation and resume screening. Many engineering managers asked computer science fundamentals questions. Binary trees where a particularly popular interview topic. I’ve begun an open source github repo to help candidates prepare for technical interviews: https://github.com/connor11528/coding-interviews"</p>
      <p><strong>But that isn’t necessarily front end.</strong></p>
      <p>“Right, we wanted to make sure that they were logical and we knew that that’s what the companies that we were sending them to would test them with. For front-end roles, we also placed a lot of weight on their portfolios. If you’re going to be a front-end engineer, you have to have a really clean portfolio. You would be shocked by how many portfolios that just weren’t ready.” </p>
      <p><strong>What’s the best approach to landing a software engineer position?</strong></p>
      <p>“I think that building something really cool would be the best approach. I looked at a lot of bootcamp projects and after they finished it, they just walked away from it. And it’s like, if it’s that cool, why are you walking away from it?”</p>
      <p><strong>Are recruiters willing to work with bootcamp graduates?</strong></p>
      <p>“No, because employers aren’t willing to pay that extra money for bootcamp graduates. Employers could probably go directly to those bootcamps if they saw talent there.”</p>
      <p><strong>You did a lot of recruiting in the Bay Area, what are the ranges for entry, mid, and senior level roles?</strong></p>
      <p>“I would say, for software engineering titles, the minimum for entry level is 80k and if a candidate asked for less then it would definitely raise red flags because it shows that they are desperate. For senior-level, the sky's the limit but 100k would be the absolute lowest. With people starting out, I would recommend them to look into contracting.”</p>
      <p><strong>Any last advice/ thoughts? </strong></p>
      <p>“If your goal is to make six figures, learn AWS.”</p>
