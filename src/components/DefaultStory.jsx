    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Wayne, Site Reliability Specialist at Facebook</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Wayne Banks. He is a Site Reliability Specialist at Facebook. Wayne has been through many obstacles on his way of becoming a Site Reliability Specialist, but despite all odds he came out on top. Here is his interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“I am a veteran who has taken a non-traditional path into tech. I began my journey while at Morehouse College; I was an economics undergraduate and I wanted to create opportunities to develop my leadership and business acumen, so I began to execute one of my business ideas that forced me to develop my technical skillset in order to bring it to life. The funny thing is I never considered going into the tech field - it was my desire to build my ideas that made being technical necessary.</p>
    <p>After I graduated from college, I spent some time as an MBA student at SF State but I felt that I was being led away from my passion. I decided that I would take a risk and invest my energy into dreams. I remember the day when I went to Startup Grind and was so inspired by these business and tech people who had chased their goals and won, so I vowed to keep my Startup Grind bracelet on until I found a way to get my startup funded. In 2016, I completed a web development and a product management immersive through General Assembly; this experience afforded me an opportunity to be hired as a software intern with Adobe’s PhotoShop Lightroom. I began my experience focusing on engineering and concluded the experience working in a product management capacity.</p>
    <p>After my internship, I chose to go to another technical program through Learners Guild. I have mixed emotions about this program, but it was necessary for me to take additional time and digest the complex material I was being exposed to. I don’t think the ‘three-months-and-become-an-engineer’ model works for me. It may work for some, but I saw I needed more time to process the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’. Even though I want to work in product, I know I needed to be technical. I would need to think like an engineer and a business person. Throughout my journey, I have challenged myself to develop my repertoire by working on both product and engineering in my own projects and open-sourced joint software.</p>
    <p>My initiative was enough to get the attention of a few recruiters that worked at companies that interested me. I had no idea that following my passion would lead me to a life changing opportunity at the company of my dreams. In October 2017, I was hired by Facebook. I will be working in Product Operations.”</p>
    <p><strong>What made you want to become a Software Engineer?</strong></p>
    <p>“I wanted to become a software engineer because I wanted the tools to build my ideas. I felt limited by my inability to code, so I changed it. I wasn’t planning to become an engineer, but I loved the power and control I was granted by being an engineer. My ultimate desire was to become a technical product manager, so I can lead products through the entire software development life cycle.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us about the obstacles that you had to overcome to be where you are today?</strong></p>
    <p>“I faced several obstacles. I lost my grandmother and a few other important family members and became homeless. I spent the first year of post-grad living in shelters and transitional housing. I would study computer science and prepare for the GRE all day, and this helped me to get to this point. I could have gone down the path of many others and formed a reliance on addiction, but I chose to use this pressure to mold me. I poured my energy into pursuit of my dreams. I was given transitional housing through Swords to Plowshares and attended a workshop on tech sales - given through Sales Hacker. An acquaintance, Donte, I made at this event encouraged me to find a way to attend a technical program, and that led me to going to General Assembly. If I had not met Donte, I would never have gotten into tech. If I had not been homeless, I would not have met Donte. Indeed, everything happens for a reason.”</p>
    <p><strong>What are some advice for people who are looking to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>“The advice I would have for aspiring software engineers would be to consider your experience learning any other complex material. It may not be easy, but it is possible. Keep this in mind. Make sure you have a growth mindset and don’t be afraid of not knowing; focus, instead, on learning. It takes time and dedication, it doesn’t happen over night. I would, also, suggest finding other developers to code with - this is where I learn the most. Leverage your fellow developers; this helps to supplement your learning and build a valuable ally that you can network with throughout your career. Lastly, I would encourage you to study your ideal role and ensure you gain the skills to fill out the majority of the job’s description. If they are working in React, learn React. If you need back-end, learn the back-end. Be well-versed in the front and back, but find something that speaks to you. I enjoy the back-end. I made sure to understand forms, databases, schema design, promises querying, and passing info to the front-end. Find your passion and learn as much as you can. Keep in mind, there are people out there who have been coding everyday since they were 12. I am not saying this to frighten you, but you must be realistic. If you want to be an engineer, you’re going to have to work! You must want it bad enough to work hard enough to get good enough. There are no limits in life if you work hard enough to remove them. It’s simple - you get out what you put in. There are no shortcuts. Believe me, those who cut corners will one day fear the straight-aways. Don’t skip the fundamentals. I know data structures and algorithms are complex, but they are necessary. Learn them!”</p>
    <p><strong>If you could have done something differently to be where you are at, what would it be?</strong></p>
    <p>"I would say that I would not change anything about my journey, because it is what made me what I am today. I do wish I had become a better developer though."</p>
    <p><strong>Did you have any mentors along the way? If so, how did they help you? If not, would you have wanted a mentor and what would they have done?</strong></p>
    <p>"I have had TONS of mentors. I lost both of my parents at an early age. This caused me to rely on God and people who were willing to help me become successful. Outside of family, I have to give credit to Dr. Joseph Marshall of Omega Boys Club. Dr. Marshall runs a nonprofit that tackles the problems of at-risk-youth and helps the youth to stay ‘alive and free’. Dr. Marshall has helped over 210 students become college graduates and even more find other paths to change their lives. I did not go through the Omega program, but Dr. Marshall believed in me and funded my ENTIRE undergraduate education that wasn’t covered by the GI Bill, scholarships, or loans. I would not have graduated, if it weren’t for Omega. In addition to the finances, I was given support and guidance; on occasions, when I had an unforeseen financial emergency, Doc stepped in and offered resources out of his pocket. Another important mentor was Randy Riggins, a senior engineering manager from Adobe. Randy and I met while I worked for Adobe and he made it his job to make sure I had everything that I needed to be successful. He was just someone who was blessed with resources that he wanted to share, both job opportunities and his knowledge. There was never a time that I can remember needing anything and Randy not being willing to offer to help. I hope to someday be in a position to help someone who, like me, just needs a little help and guidance. Without these two leaders, I would not have made a portion of the progress."</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us about your support group and how they kept you going during tough times?</strong></p>
    <p>“My best resource were fellow developers who I had studied or worked with; I would lean on them and share our experiences. Prayer - prayer is my best friend.”</p>
    <p><strong>Are you currently working on any side projects?</strong></p>
    <p>“I am working on <a href = "https://tllis.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Limelight</a> app, a SAAS artist development platform - coming soon, and I am working on a mentorship application called The Mentor app - coming soon.”</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any last thoughts/advice?</strong></p>
    <p>“Never give up. Never stop learning, even on the job. This is a competitive field that requires you to know a lot. Don’t forget that just because you got a job. Keep growing. A rolling stone catches no moss. Remaining stagnant can make you a dinosaur. Don’t be a dinosaur. You see how that worked out for them.”</p>
