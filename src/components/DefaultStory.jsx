    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Stephen, Software Engineer at Marketo</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Stephen Leung. He is a Software Engineer at Marketo. Stephen is passionate about programing and has gone through Hack Reactor to become a Software Engineer. Here is the interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“I graduated from UC Davis with an Applied Physics Degree and I decided to become a teacher. Both of my parents were teachers so it was inevitable that I would give teaching a try. I even got a master’s degree in education. I taught public high school math for four years. I liked it but I didn’t like it enough to do it for the rest of my life. I considered programming because I grew up playing computer games; not relevant, but still. This was in 2011, there weren’t really any bootcamps, so I decided to try to get into the tech field through working with hardware. But working on servers wasn’t helping me write any software, and I wasn’t anywhere near my goal of being a software engineer. I started out teaching myself a little bit of coding, and when I found FreeCodeCamp, I used it to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I still didn’t feel ready applying for jobs so, in 2016, I quit my job as an Information Systems Technician to pursue programming full-time. I stumbled across Hack Reactor. I applied to their program, but was rejected. The week after that was terrible, because I felt that I was ready and that they didn’t know how much I knew. I was pretty bummed; it felt like getting rejected from your dream school. But the upside was that I could reapply in three months, so I devoted a lot of my time to studying basic JavaScript. I got in my second time around.”</p>
    <p><strong>What did you learn in Hack Reactor?</strong></p>
    <p>“They didn’t focus too much on HTML and CSS, but really dived deep into JavaScript. We worked with CS fundamentals like data structures and algorithm design, D3, AngularJS, Backbone.js, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Git.  That’s all that I can remember for now but there might have been more frameworks and libraries. We then had collaborative projects where we built several applications from scratch - anything we wanted. Looking back, we made some amazing apps.”</p>
    <p><strong>How did you like the program?</strong></p>
    <p>“It was good. I liked working and learning with other people who wanted to be software engineers. It prepared me well. They had job coaches; we would work on projects to showcase our programming knowledge, and we had a lot of mock interviews.”</p>
    <p><strong>What was the job search process like?</strong></p>
    <p>“It takes time. It took me four months after graduation to find a job. By the time that I received my offer, I had submitted around 300 applications. Of those 300 applications, I only received 4 phone screens, 2 onsite interviews and 1 job offer. The job offer was good so I accepted it. It was stressful because there’s so much uncertainty. But looking back, I didn’t need to be as stressed. It’s a process, and you have to persist with continuously learning and persevere through all the rejections.”</p>
    <p><strong>What was the job interview process like with the company that you received an offer with?</strong></p>
    <p>“The initial part was a 30-minute phone screen. Then, it was an algorithm challenge through Skype. The final part was a four-hour on-site interview with multiple white boarding exercises from several engineers.”</p>
    <p><strong>Would you have done anything differently looking backwards?</strong></p>
    <p>“Not necessarily, because Hack Reactor helped me learn things much quicker than what I would have learned on my own. I do wish that I found people trying to become software engineers prior to going to Hack Reactor because I feel like I could have grasped certain concepts much quicker if someone was there to point me toward the right direction. That’s a reason why I go to FreeCodeCamp meetups now, because I want to be the person that I needed when I was becoming a software engineer.”</p>
    <p><strong>What is some advice for people who are trying to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>“It’s important to figure out what you are passionate about. If you like designing and making things look good, maybe you’ll want to focus on being a Front-End Developer. If you’re a very logical person, you might think about being a Back-End Developer. It’s important to understand what it is that you like to do because you don’t want to hate your job. You want to do something that you love.”</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any last thoughts/advice?</strong></p>
    <p>“Becoming a Software Engineer is a long journey, so just keep at it. Nobody should have to go through the journey alone, so reach out and meet with people going through, or have gone through, the same transformation.”</p>
