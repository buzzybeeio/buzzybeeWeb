    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Dante, CTO at Corisaude</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Dante Nolasco. He is the CTO of Corisaude, a startup working to improve elderly health. Dante’s startup was created at a Hackathon, where his team won $30,000 and a contract with the second largest health insurance company in Brazil. Here is the interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“I am 18 years old, I live in Brazil, and I like to create and learn new things. My family is involved in fashion retail and I was involved in it when I was young. In 2014, I moved to another city for high school and to attend a business program. At that time, I watched startups closely which sparked my interest in graphic design and filmmaking. In 2015, I attended an international event in NYC and I received the Best Web Design Award for a company created on a school project. It was a really simple project created on Wix but winning the award pushed me along the trajectory of programming. Since then, I started getting more and more involved with programming and web design. I had my first job when I was 17 as a Front-End React Developer at an entrepreneurial education startup.”</p>
    <p><strong>How did you start coding?</strong></p>
    <p>“I was always very interested in numbers and computers, especially Excel. When I was 12, I took an online HTML course from Codecademy. Since then, I have been involved with technology, especially web development. For a long time, programming was just a hobby and I was more interested on learning concepts instead of putting them into practice. It wasn’t until I was 16 that I saw programming as a real opportunity and something that I could pursue as a career. I decided to try out building a career in coding. Since then, I have been learning a lot from online courses offered through Coursera, Udemy, and Udacity.”</p>
    <p><strong>What inspired you to want to become a software engineer?</strong></p>
    <p>“I think what caught my attention is how challenging it is. It's different from being hard, but it involves a lot of creativity and problem solving, and I always enjoyed things like LEGO and puzzles. I think it has some things in common, and that's what inspired me. For the last two years, I’ve become more motivated as I started getting more involved with startups and bigger projects.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little about Corisaude?</strong></p>
    <p>“Sure! Cori is a startup company focused on improving elderly health. It was created in 2016 during a Startup Weekend event at my school. Since then, we’ve developed the product and business model by participating in acceleration programs. Cori helps fragile patients, who need full-time monitoring by a caregiver. Cori helps monitor their daily routines, behavior, eating habits and other variables in order to prevent hospitalization. There are only four people involved in the company and I am the only one with programming skills. It has been a really interesting approach, being both an entrepreneur and software engineer. This experience really changed the way I think about coding. I had to start learning not only about databases and frameworks, but also about geriatrics and elderly patients' challenges of using smartphones. I also learned concepts like statistical analysis for big data, AI, and Scrum - things I consider essential for every software engineer.”</p>
    <p><strong>What is some advice that you would give to people who are trying to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>“First you should find an area you enjoy. In my case, it was web design. Then, you dive deep into learning the concepts, usage and frameworks. Keep pushing yourself to always create bigger projects and ensure you really have that knowledge. The learning part is pretty hard, because you have to manage it by yourself. Once you feel confident about your skills, start looking for jobs. My personal advice is to start in a small company, especially if you have never worked before. This gives you more responsibility and makes you grow professionally.”</p>
    <p><strong>Did anyone help you in becoming a software engineer? If so, how did they help you?</strong></p>
    <p>“Yes, my family have always supported me and encouraged me to always face bigger challenges. I am also very thankful for my teachers and colleagues from high school, who recognized my skills and helped me network.”</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any mentors? How have they impacted you on your journey?</strong></p>
    <p>“Unfortunately I don’t have any mentors, and this is something I regret and would like to change. I really think that having a mentor makes things easier.”</p>
    <p><strong>Any last thoughts/advice?</strong></p>
    <p>“Make sure you enjoy what you are doing, and always have in mind two things: learning and networking. With skill and opportunity, you will reach your goals. Keep pushing to be the best.”</p>
