    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Anthony, CTO at FOWNDERS</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Anthony Delgado. Anthony has had a passion for coding since he was a kid and he managed to become a CTO without a CS degree. Here is his story:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“I started coding around 2007 full-time but even before that I was already doing a lot of things with computers. I knew some basic HTML from the geocities and myspace days. My mother was a programmer and she got me my first computer when I was in the second grade. It was a DOS computer so I had to learn all the command line prompts and by the time I was in my teens, I was proficient with computers. We had dial-up internet since the early 90s and I was the first person I knew who had access to the internet. I also became a white hat hacker and I would remove viruses from computers that were infected. I was always infatuated with computers, but I didn’t really start writing functional logical code until 2007. In 2007, I sold my first company and started an e-commerce company, it was somewhat of a failed startup but I learned a ton of stuff along the way. ”</p>
    <p><strong>What did you go to college for?</strong></p>
    <p>“I actually dropped out of college, but I went to Ramapo. For a year, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to study business or criminal justice and I was losing aspiration. At the time, college just wasn’t for me so I dropped out of college to start a brick-and-mortar retail store. I eventually sold that store because I wanted to create an online version of it. I knew that it would be a better business strategy to have an online store instead of a physical store and that’s what launched my start into coding. I knew that if we wanted to sell things online, creating an online store was the vehicle to do that. I started out with osCommerce, OpenCart, and cPanel installs. When I wanted something customized I would layer my own code on top of pre-existing software but I wasn’t necessarily a software developer. I saw myself as more of a digital marketer / hacker who was really good at making websites. I wasn’t aware of the world of software developers; there was no Tech Scene in New York City during that time.”</p>
    <p><strong>How did you land your first software developer role?</strong></p>
    <p>“After my startup, I started researching. I read online forums, I was on Stack Overflow - anything that I could to level up my skills. I worked on tons of side projects and I freelanced for local businesses in my area. One of the companies that I freelanced for was CraniumFitteds. They weren’t called CraniumFitteds yet and they didn’t have an online presence but I was able to help them create a brand and an online presence. And in their first year after having an online medium, they made over $3 million in sales. Eventually I started working there full-time and it was my first full time gig in Tech.”</p>
    <p><strong>What inspired you to attend a coding bootcamp although you were already very knowledgeable?</strong></p>
    <p>“After my first gig, I worked for an IT consulting firm called TDNYC. There I learned a lot about networking, TCP/IP, telephony and corporate business infrastructure. I rebuilt their website, managed their digital marketing and even built some Twilio apps along the way. I learned a lot there but I knew that corporate technology wasn’t for me. If I wanted to progress as an engineer  I needed to be working in a startup environment with other full stack developers, writing code on a daily basis.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Next I accepted an offer to become a full stack developer at a digital agency called Websignia. Websignia was the first place where I got to work with other developers hands on, and this allowed me to learn all these best practices, how to properly use Git, using NPM to install packages, and so on. I leveled up a lot and ended up being the lead of their Tech Department and I was the one doing hire interviews. I got a chance to interview a graduate from Rutgers Bootcamp and he showed me all these awesome projects that he built and he was so passionate about them. This gave me flashbacks from five years ago when I was building things just for fun and it inspired me to look into the Bootcamp. I signed Websignia up as a hiring partner with the Rutgers and I also signed up to take their full course because I was so impressed with what they had to offer. I wanted to find that passion that I had when I was younger. I didn’t have a Computer Science Degree so I also wanted validation from society and attending that coding bootcamp gave me the confidence that I needed.”</p>
    <p><strong>For people trying to become software developers, what kind of advice would you give them? Would you advise them to self-study or attend a coding bootcamp?</strong></p>
    <p>“I would advise them to do both. I saw people at my coding bootcamp who were doing it for a job and I think that that’s the wrong reason because you have to have a passion for creating software and making things from scratch. Some people just aren’t cut out for it. The best way to find out is using free online resources to assess if you truly want to write code for a living. If that is the case, then you should attend a coding bootcamp and build on top of that passion because there are people who are not cut out for it and they are spending thousands of dollars to find that out. If it is for you, then you should go into the bootcamp with an open mentality and learn as much as possible.”</p>
    <p><strong>What is your suggestion for bootcamp graduates that are having a hard time finding a job?</strong></p>
    <p>“You just have to be relentless. I recently interviewed a Rutgers graduate and he was in the job market for a year after graduating but he was relentless. He took four different internships, he was tutoring, he took Udemy courses online, he taught himself new libraries and frameworks, and he kept applying until he landed a full-time job. Take a low-paying internship if you have to because you’ll learn a lot from it. Also make sure that your personal portfolio website is polished and create a brand around yourself.”</p>
    <p><strong>Any final thoughts/ advice?</strong></p>
    <p>“Be relentless, be ruthless, and stop fearing people. I experienced introversion when I was younger but I came out of my shell entirely because I realized that we need to stop fearing people. Sometimes who you know is more important than what you know.”</p>
