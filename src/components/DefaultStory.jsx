    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Jonathan Ankiewicz. He is a software engineer at Ten-X. Jonathan made a transition the transition as a Security Officer to Software Engineer. Here is the interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“I joined the Marine Corps instead of college, I felt I needed a bit more structure and purpose than what I was getting through normal society. And, I got just that. I joined the Marine Corps and a year later a few people couldn’t even recognize who I had become because of my behavior change; besides looking a little muscular, I didn’t change much physically. I learned a lot in the Marines and I returned from my 5 years in with one tour to Iraq a new person.</p>
    <p>I had no idea what to do with myself as I got out. Luckily for me, I was approached by a recruiter who made my decision easier. He encouraged me to step into the executive protection field, and I became a bodyguard for CEO’s and celebrities; the earpiece and red carpet type of body guard. This lasted a few years. To become a better protector, I became a Nationally Certified EMT. I was given the opportunity to do some work out of Stanford ER as an ER Tech, at the same time that I was working security.</p>
    <p>I saw all this as work. My personal passion at the time was the gym. I lived and breathed fitness. I got certified through International Sports Science Association. I even published my own book, Simple and Fit, available on Amazon. I trained a few people on the side--mostly pro bono; honestly, I was making far more money as an Executive Security Specialist then I would have made training at a gym.</p>
    <p>While working for a CEO at tech company, I began learning a bit about tech; enough to give me the motivation to start my own online fitness training company, this is where the idea of SimpleFi.com was born; this is my passion project, and it is still in the development phase several years later.</p>
    <p>I made the decision to start my own company and begin the research. I started with the business plan and VC pitches. I quickly learned I needed a prototype to make any real progress, so I sought out developers. These developers immediately expressed the need for a design and proof of concept. At the same time, the stars aligned and I was given the chance to participate in a school tour for a Web Design and New Media degree from the San Francisco Campus’ Academy of Art. I didn’t cut any corners. For the next three years, I worked full time and went to college full time.</p>
    <p>Upon graduating, I decided that it was my time to make the full transition from bodyguard to designer. As a modern designer, Academy of Art allowed me to study the basics of coding and design principles, while we were given a chance to develop our own portfolios and giving us the ability to heavily participate in the development process. During my interview process, on my second interview in the tech field I interviewed at Auction.com (Ten-X now) for their marketing team. As I went in for my interview I was surprised to find that my code was admired more than my design. My design was kind of weak, according the high standards of the marketing team, but my code was on par; my ability to truly understand design, UX, and the code made me an even greater asset. In turn, I was offered a position as Web Developer on the Marketing Team. This was the start of my Development career.</p>
    <p>While developing campaigns and finding ways to get around marketing department’s limitations, I started diving deeper into the world of development. I began to love coding more than any other career/job I have ever had. My ability to code and problem solve combined with the discipline the Marine Corps instilled in me, and I felt as if I was a force to be reckoned with. Within 6 months, I found myself in a senior web development role. On my own accord, I began reaching across departments, touching every facet of the company to increase the quality of communications to our users and stakeholders --from the HR department to the product teams. 6 months in the field, and I was already setting quality standards across a multi-million-dollar enterprise.</p>
    <p>Two years later, I was wrapping up a second college degree from the Academy of Art as an advertising art director. Getting ready to put my self-taught software engineering chops to the test. Due to my hard work and occasionally helping the engineering teams on a project here and there, I was given the opportunity to interview for a software engineering position on the product team. The grind was finally paying off, nailed it! I have been working on that team since, only diving deeper into the engineering side of code.”</p>
    <p><strong>What made you want to become a Software Engineer?</strong></p>
    <p>“I never knew I wanted to be one. I fell into it by chance and found it to be one of my greatest passions. I find that I can spend 8 plus hours at work, coding. I then go home and spend another 6 to 10 working on fun personal projects and learning. My wife isn’t the biggest fan of the addiction, but she does her best at keeping me grounded in the real world.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us about the obstacles that you had to overcome to be where you are today?</strong></p>
    <p>“1: adapting to the civilian world. Private security was military heavy and maintained a lot of that mindset. Coming in to the corporate world, you must speak to people differently and approach problems and interact with teams differently. I think one of the biggest things I had to learn is that work is not the military. Lives do NOT depend on yours and/or your team's ability to get a task done and done on time. Most civilians aren’t willing to pull a 24-hour shift in order to accomplish a task.</p>
    <p>2: Self-taught engineering requires for you to fight for the respect. There are a few people in the field who automatically take a notch off your belt just for not having a college degree.”</p>
    <p><strong>What advice do you have for people who are looking to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>"There is a lot to learn in this field. Self taught and coding bootcamps is a great way to go; it’s not the easiest, but it’s more productive and much faster than the typical college route--assuming your willing to put your heart and soul into it. Taking a bootcamp or self teaching is great, but you have to fight a lot harder in the interview process to show your ability to compete with your peers.</p>
    <p>If you require structure, I recommend college. They will give you everything you need to know from the ground up.</p>
    <p>If you are well organized, motivated and Love the Grind, I recommend bootcamps and self teaching.</p>
    <p>The number one thing to know is that you can do it! Anyone can do it.</p>
    <p>All it requires is learning the basics and starting somewhere simple. It looks complicated, if you are looking at software a 10 year veteran wrote or a enterprise-level software, of course. Please remember, you can accomplish and learn a lot in 10 years, so if you’re just starting don’t be discouraged. If your looking at enterprise software, just remember this: that software took years to develop, and most often, it has been written by hundreds and even thousands of people."</p>
    <p><strong>If you could have done something differently to be where you are at, what would it be?</strong></p>
    <p>"I am not sure I would, my background makes me a really unique person in this industry, and once I gain the years of software engineer experience, I believe strongly I can be found amongst the greats."</p>
    <p><strong>Did you have any mentors along the way? If so, how did they help you? If not, would you have wanted a mentor and what would they have done?</strong></p>
    <p>"I had an amazing Mentor. Jon Rahoi. He helped to boost my confidence in coding and gave me some directions on where to direct my studies, so that I was competitive with other software engineers. It’s very easy to get distracted by the next shiny thing in tech."</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any mentors? How have they impacted you on your journey?</strong></p>
    <p>"I didn’t have a support group. I, actually, had a lot of people ask why I worked so hard; I was told to slow down and enjoy life more. It was kind of discouraging, but it’s crazy to see how many people around you are just simply content with where they are in life. I am still working on finding my support group. My wife supports me a lot, but she has no idea what I am talking about half the time."</p>
    <p><strong>Are you currently working on any side projects?</strong></p>
    <p>"Yes, I am working on creating an open source project for veterans by veterans. I want to create a social platform that allows veterans to communicate and help encourage, mentor, and share knowledge across generations. I want it to be available to any veteran who is in tech and interested in participating; it will be a great resume building and it would allow them to give back to fellow veterans. I hope that it will become a healthy staple in the transition process from the military to the civilian world.</p>
    <p>I am also still working on SimpleFi.com."</p>
    <p><strong>Why should veterans work in tech? Being a vet, what has been your experience, so far?</strong></p>
    <p>"Veterans are a perfect fit for tech. They have innate ability to problem resolve, evaluate the situation at hand, and make a decisions on how to move forward. My favorite aspect of working with veterans is their reliability. Veterans know when to have a good time; they make sure to bond with their co-workers and throw jokes around, but at a moment’s notice, they can transition into a get stuff done attitude; completely mission oriented."</p>
    <p><strong>What are the best Free resources for developers/people in tech?</strong></p>
    <p>"It’s not free, but my all time favorite place to learn is: Teamtreehouse.com - <a href="http://referrals.trhou.se/jonathanankiewicz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://referrals.trhou.se/jonathanankiewicz</a> (here is a referral code). KhanAcademy is a recent discovery. Youtube has a million different tutorials, some good some bad but all aimed at helping you learn. CodeCademy is also a great resource. There are some free courses at Udacity."</p>
    <p><strong>Any last thoughts/advice for people who are trying to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>"Don’t be afraid to do it. It will take a lot of work, but 20 minutes a day can still get to the point of programing your own thing within a year. I know a lot of people who express interest but spend years and months saying “I will start tomorrow” or “there is just so much to learn, I couldn’t possibly get any value from today or this weekend…” This is the wrong mindset. Spend 20 minutes today; ten minutes tomorrow; three hours next saturday. All of that knowledge will accumulate a lot faster than you could imagine, and you will, at least, be making projects for yourself within weeks."</p>
