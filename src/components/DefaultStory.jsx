    <h4 className="story-title"><em>Aileen, Software Engineer Intern at Solv.</em></h4>
    <p><em>This week we got a chance to interview Aileen Santos. Aileen is a Software Engineer Intern at Solv Health. Prior to coding, Aileen was a teacher because she believes in education and contributing to society. Aileen continues to advocate for social causes through her coding. Here is the interview:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about your background?</strong></p>
    <p>“Before I started coding, I was a teacher. I taught middle school students who were in ESL; ESL stands for English as a Second Language. I did it for five years. I come from a family of teachers so it was a natural fit. But eventually, I felt like it wasn’t what I was meant to do. However, teaching did help me realize that I really liked learning which transitioned to programming.”</p>
    <p><strong>How were you introduced to coding?</strong></p>
    <p>“I started coding in college and I fell in love with building websites because I loved seeing the sites live. And even when I was teaching ESL classes, I would teach kids how to code after school. From that, I decided to pursue coding so I applied to General Assembly and I received a full scholarship to go there. I attended General Assembly but after three months, I wasn’t quite ready so I applied to Learners Guild.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit more about General Assembly?</strong></p>
    <p>“It’s a very big coding school, they are all over the world. They are pretty big, their brand is established, they have money to provide scholarships. They also have a funnel into companies. They mostly taught JavaScript libraries and frameworks but we also worked with Ruby on Rails.”</p>
    <p><strong>How was your experience looking for jobs after attending General Assembly?</strong></p>
    <p>“I came into General Assembly with very little coding knowledge, so I didn’t feel like I was prepared after graduation. I feel like I could have gotten jobs if I lived in another state but we are in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley so there’s a lot of great programmers. I felt like GA was too short for me and I wasn’t ready for the technical interviews.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us about Learners Guild and how was it different from General Assembly?</strong></p>
    <p>“Learners Guild has a different learning model. There’s a lot more emphasis on self direction at Learners Guild as opposed to the strict schedule at General Assembly. I had to learn how to be more self-disciplined at Learners Guild.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you walk us through what you’re currently doing at Solv Health?</strong></p>
    <p>“I’m interested in front-end so a lot of the tasks that are assigned to me have high visibility and high user interaction. I worked on the paperless feature for patients to be able to digitally submit intake forms to clinics. I am also working on features that entice clinics to join Solv such as the Clinic Rating Calculator.”</p>
    <p><strong>Can you tell us about your experience with technical interviews?</strong></p>
    <p>“It’s different with every company. With the startup that I’m currently at, the first interview was having coffee. I had a phone screen. I had to pair program with them, which is what I really preferred because it allows me to show what I can do and see how I work with the team. However, I had an interview with a big company and they asked me algorithm questions and I had to show my answers and thinking using a whiteboard. I didn’t really like the whiteboarding experience but I’m working on being better at it.”</p>
    <p><strong>If you could go back in time, would you approach anything differently?</strong></p>
    <p>“I would go to a more rigorous program. There’s a program called The Grace Hopper Academy in New York and it’s deferred payment. I would have applied and gone there.”</p>
    <p><strong>What would you advise for people who are trying to become software engineers?</strong></p>
    <p>“It depends on how you learn. If you have a passion for coding just keep doing it, study hard, and I would advise people to follow their own route and try not to compare themselves to others. There isn’t just one path.”</p>
    <p><strong>Any last advice/ thoughts? </strong></p>
    <p>“Use your difference as an advantage. I saw this queer black woman speak at a conference and she completely stood out. The way she was dressed and her demeanor. However, she was confident in that difference. Most people shy away from that, but her talk showed how you can use your difference to set you apart and give you a higher advantage.”</p>
